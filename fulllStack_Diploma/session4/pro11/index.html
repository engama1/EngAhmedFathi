					But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing 
					pleasure and praising
					pain was born and I will give you a complete account of the system,
					and expound the actual teachings of the great explorer of the truth
					the master-builder of human happiness. No one rejects, dislikes, or 
					avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, but because those 
					who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter 
					consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again is there 
					anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself,
					because it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances occur 
					in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure. To
					take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious
					physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it? But
					who has any right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy
					a pleasure that has no annoying consequences, or one who avoids 
					a pain that produces no resultant 
					pleasure because it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances occur 
					in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure. To
					take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious
					physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it? But

					pleasure
